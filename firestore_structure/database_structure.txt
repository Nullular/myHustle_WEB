Alright, let's systematically break down the data points and typical entry formats for each collection ("table" in your terms, but in Firestore, we call them collections of documents ) based on your provided Firebase Security Rules.
Remember, these rules primarily define access control, so the fields I'll highlight are those directly referenced or implied by the permissions logic. A real document would likely contain many more fields for your application's functionality!
Here's a detailed list:
1. users Collection

Purpose : Stores individual user profiles.
Document ID ( {userId} ) : This is typically the Firebase Authentication User ID ( request.auth.uid ).
Key Data Points :
No specific fields are explicitly checked within the users document itself for read or write access beyond the document ID matching the authenticated user's uid . However, a typical user profile would include:
name (string)
email (string)
profilePictureUrl (string)
createdAt (timestamp)
Subcollection: users/{userId}/memberships

Purpose : Likely links users to specific chats or groups they are part of, perhaps storing user-specific chat settings.
Document ID ( {chatId} ) : The ID of the chat document this membership pertains to.
Key Data Points :
No specific fields are checked within the memberships document by the rules directly, but they are created/updated based on the user being a participant in the parent chats collection.
Implied fields might be: lastReadMessageTimestamp (timestamp), unreadCount (number), chatName (string, copy of chat name for quick display).
2. shops Collection

Purpose : Stores information about businesses or service providers.
Document ID ( {shopId} ) : A unique identifier for each shop.
Key Data Points :

Implied: name (string), description (string), price (number), imageUrls (array of strings), stock (number), etc.
4. services Collection

Purpose : Stores details about services offered by shops.
