## Testing Recommendations

### Review Display Testing

2. Check if reviews are now visible
3. Navigate to Product screens and verify review display
4. Test review creation and verify immediate display

### Booking Management Testing
1. Navigate to Booking Management screen
2. Verify "This week's highlights" shows real data

4. Check revenue calculations match actual booking prices

### Analytics Testing

5. Verify loading states display properly

## Database Dependencies
- Reviews: Uses `isVisible` and `isFlagged` fields
- Bookings: Requires `timestamp`, `status`, `serviceName` fields
- Orders: Uses `timestamp`, `status`, `items` with `name` and `price` fields
- Services: Requires `name` and `price` fields for revenue calculation

## Performance Notes
- All data loading implemented with proper coroutines
- Loading states prevent UI blocking
- Error handling ensures graceful failures
- Repository pattern maintains clean separation of concerns

## Future Enhancements
- Consider adding data caching for better performance
- Implement pull-to-refresh for real-time updates
- Add date range selectors for custom analytics periods
- Consider adding export functionality for analytics data
