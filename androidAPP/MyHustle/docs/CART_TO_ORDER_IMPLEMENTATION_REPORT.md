- **Changes**:
  - Integrated CheckoutService for live processing
  - Added loading states and error handling
  - Real-time checkout processing with progress indicator
  - Improved UX with success/error feedback
  - Disabled button during processing to prevent duplicate orders

### 4. Database Operations
- **Product Inventory Updates**:
  - `stockQuantity` decremented by quantity sold
  - `unitsSold` incremented by quantity sold
  - `inStock` updated based on remaining stock
  - `updatedAt` timestamp updated
- **Variant Inventory Updates**:
  - Product variants stock updated if selected
  - Size variants stock updated if selected
  - Variant availability updated based on stock
- **Order Creation**:
  - Complete order records with all items
  - Customer information populated
  - Order status set to PENDING
  - Payment status set to PENDING
- **Booking Creation**:

  - Customer and shop information populated
  - Status set to PENDING

## üîÑ WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION

### Cart-to-Order Process:
1. User clicks "Proceed to Payment" in CheckoutScreen
2. CheckoutService.processCheckout() is called
3. Cart items are categorized (products vs services)
4. Product items are grouped by shop
5. For each shop:
   - Create Order with OrderItems
   - Calculate totals (subtotal + delivery fee)
   - Set customer and shop information
   - Save order to Firebase with unique order number
6. For each service item:
   - Create individual Booking record
   - Set customer, shop, and service information
   - Save booking to Firebase
7. Update product inventory:
   - Reduce stockQuantity by quantity sold
   - Increase unitsSold by quantity sold
   - Update inStock status
   - Update variant inventories if applicable
8. Clear cart after successful processing
9. Navigate user back or show success message

}
```

## üß™ TESTING & VERIFICATION

### CheckoutTest Class Created:
- **File**: `CheckoutTest.kt`
- **Purpose**: Verify checkout functionality works correctly
- **Features**:
  - Tests cart-to-order conversion
  - Verifies inventory updates
  - Confirms database persistence
  - Logs detailed process information

### Testing Commands:
```kotlin
// Call from any activity to test
CheckoutTest.runTest()
```

## üîí ERROR HANDLING & VALIDATION

### Implemented Safeguards:
- ‚úÖ User authentication verification
- ‚úÖ Empty cart validation  
- ‚úÖ Inventory availability checks
- ‚úÖ Database transaction safety
- ‚úÖ Network error handling
