# 🚀 MyHustle Database Setup Guide

## Quick Start - Your App is Ready!

You now have a **complete database setup system** built into your app! Here's how to use it:

### Step 1: Run Your App
1. **Build the app**: `.\gradlew build`
2. **Install on device**: `.\gradlew installDebug`
3. **Launch the app** - it will open directly to the Setup Screen

### Step 2: Setup Your Database
When the app opens, you'll see the **Database Setup Screen** with:

#### 🔧 **Test Connection**
- Click "Test" to verify Firebase is working
- Should show: ✅ Firebase connection successful

#### 🏗️ **Complete Setup**
- Enter your admin email (default: `owner@myhustle.com`)
- Enter password (default: `password123`)
- Click "Complete Setup"

This will automatically:
- Create your user account
- Set up your first shop
- Add sample products and services
- Initialize all database collections

### Step 3: What Gets Created

Your database will have **11 collections**:

1. **users** - Your admin account
2. **shops** - Your first shop ("My First Shop")  
3. **products** - 2 sample products
4. **services** - 2 sample services
5. **orders** - Ready for customer orders
6. **bookings** - Ready for service bookings
7. **conversations** - Ready for messaging
8. **messages** - Customer communication
9. **reviews** - Product/service reviews
10. **favorites** - User wishlist items
11. **notifications** - App notifications

### Step 4: Security Rules

Your Firebase will have **production-ready security rules**:
- ✅ User authentication required
- ✅ Shop owners can only edit their own content
- ✅ Customers can only access public content
- ✅ Private conversations are protected

## After Setup

### Switch Back to Normal App
Once setup is complete:

1. **Edit AppNavGraph.kt**
2. **Change line 61**: 
   ```kotlin
   startDestination = Destinations.HOME_ROUTE  // Back to normal
   ```
3. **Rebuild and enjoy your app!**

### Your Credentials
- **Email**: `owner@myhustle.com`
- **Password**: `password123`
- **Shop**: "My First Shop"
- **Products**: Sample Product 1 & 2
- **Services**: Consultation & Custom Service

## Firebase Console Next Steps

### 1. Security Rules (Auto-Deployed)
Your app automatically sets up security rules, but you can verify in Firebase Console:
- Go to **Firestore Database** → **Rules**
- Should see authentication-based rules

### 2. Indexes (Auto-Created)
The app creates these automatically, but you can monitor:
- **users**: email, userType
- **shops**: ownerId, category, isActive
- **products**: shopId, category, isActive
- **services**: shopId, isBookable, isActive

### 3. Optional Enhancements
In Firebase Console, you can:
- **Enable offline persistence**
- **Set up Analytics**
- **Configure Cloud Functions**
- **Add Push Notifications**
